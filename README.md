# The Journey of Zeplrog

Zero-player roguelike game with unique game mechanics
of a fully self-playing world with a-life system, high interactivity, emergent gameplay and great customization.

(It's the concept, not the implementation yet.)

The code is a showcase for my book [Type-Level Pragmatic Design](https://github.com/graninas/Pragmatic-Type-Level-Design).

Pragmatic Type-Level Design is a book that delves into practical concepts harnessed by the robust type system of Haskell.
